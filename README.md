# ConwayGeneticAlgorithm

This program uses a brute force solver to find the 8x8 starting grid that results in the highest fitness of a 32x32 playing field for Conway's Game of Life. The fitness of the 32x32 playing field is determined by the number of cells that are alive (=1) on the 1000th iteration of the Conway's Game of Life algorithm. The brute force solver runs through a set amount of iterations with a new randomly generated 8x8 board on each iteration and keeps track of the initial board that resulted in the highest fitness.
